 Acknowledgements:
    We went to office hours to present our design to the TA's and get feedback
    from it even though they did not provide much information. They just 
    asked us guiding questions. 
    
    We also went to office hours for a pointer 
    issue we were having when passing a pointer to a function. 
    
    Went again to office hours when we got a black diagonal line going through 
    our images being displayed. 

    We will also like to acknowledge the use 
    of the Hanson implementation textbook as a reference for this assignment.

 Correctly Implemented:
    We correctly implemented readaline.
    We correctly displayed the pgm image by printing out the the correct 
    P5 format.
    We also accounted for files that have greater than 1000 characters 
 Time spent: 
    45 hours
